This is a website for Horiseon's Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

Here is a list of things I changed in this code:

HTML:
I began by making sure that I changed the id for the SEO class so that the button became clickable. I also gave the website a unique, descriptive name in the title element. Lastly, I changed the h tag in the footer to h4 so that the headers would be sequential.

CSS: 
Most of my work for this project was done in the CSS sheet. This mostly consisted of me consolating/removing some of the redundant code. There were class items, in the footer for example, that could be grouped together without needing to apply a separate class for them. Additionally, several other classes had redundant code as well (.benefit-lead, .search-engine-optimization, .search-engine-optimization img etc)
